To select all contents of the file:
Press gg to go to the first line.
Press G to go to the last line.
Press Shift+v to enter Visual Line mode, which will select all lines between the first and last lines.
To delete the selected contents:
Press d to delete the selected lines.
Some other methods from the search results:
dG - Deletes all lines from the current cursor position to the end of the file 

ggdG - Goes to the first line, then deletes all lines to the end 
:%d or 1,$d - Deletes all lines in the file from the ex command mode 
The ggGShift+vd approach allows you to visually select the entire file contents before deleting, which can be useful for confirming the selection. However, the :%d shortcut is more concise for quickly deleting all lines
.
Cutting (Deleting) Text:
Use the d command to cut/delete text
dd cuts the entire current line
d$ cuts from the cursor to the end of the line
dW cuts from the cursor to the start of the next word
diw cuts the current word the cursor is on
d0 or d^ cuts from the cursor to the start of the line
ndd or dN cuts the current line plus N-1 lines below/above
Copying (Yanking) Text:
Use the y command to copy/yank text
yy copies/yanks the entire current line
y$ copies from the cursor to the end of the line
yiw copies the current word the cursor is on
yaw copies the current word plus trailing space
y0 or y^ copies from the cursor to the start of the line
nyy or yN copies the current line plus N-1 lines below/above
Pasting Text:
Use p to paste text after the cursor
Use P to paste text before the cursor
You can paste multiple times by using e.g. 3p to paste 3 times
Visual Mode:
Press v to enter visual mode, then use arrow keys to select text
Press d to cut the selected text
Press y to copy/yank the selected text
Press p or P to paste the text
The search results emphasize learning Vim's modal approach and "verb+noun" commands like delete inner word rather than trying to map cut/copy/paste directly. Mastering text objects and motions is key to efficiently editing in Vim.
